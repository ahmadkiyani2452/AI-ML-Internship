# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Build a classification model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on health attributes.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle

## Steps Taken
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values
- Conducted EDA with visualizations (countplot, correlation matrix)
- Used Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Results
- Binary classification accuracy score provided in output
- Model performs well on balanced dataset
